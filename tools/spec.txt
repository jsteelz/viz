jviz data format.

about: hastily conceptualized by a shitty programmer
purpose: massage gtfs into a format that can be quickly visualized (<1s loading times) for even very large gtfses

spec:

folders:
  itineraries
  trips
  trips_by_route_by_hour
  service_jkeys_by_date
  routes
  shapes

stops
  one file: stops.json, a large object where
  key: gtfs stop_id
  values:
    all gtfs-required stop attributes
  
  e.g.
  { '1':
    {
      'stop_name': 'Metro station',
      'location_type': '0',
    },
    ...
  }

shapes
  one file per shape_jkey
  filename: {shape_jkey}.geojson where shape_jkey is an md5 hash of gtfs shape_id
    file is a geojson Feature of the shape

routes
  one file per route_jkey
  filename: {route_jkey}.json where route_jkey is an md5 hash of gtfs route_id
  attributes:
    route_id (required)
    route_type (required)
    route_short_name (required if no route_long_name)
    route_long_name (required if no route_short_name)

service_jkeys_by_date
  one file per active date in the gtfs
  filename: {date}.json where date is formatted YYYYMMDD
  each file contains an array of the service_jkeys active on that date, where service_jkey is an md5 hash of gtfs service_id

trips
  one file per trip_jkey
  filename: {trip_jkey}.json where trip_jkey is an md5 hash of gtfs trip_id
  attributes:
    trip_headsign (optional)
    other gtfs- and tgtfs-optional trip fields such as block_id
    service_jkey REFERENCES service_jkeys_by_date (required)
    route_jkey REFERENCES routes (required)
    departure_time in HH:MM:SS (required)
    itinerary_id REFERENCES itineraries (required)
    timing_list: array containing the time offset in seconds from the departure time of the trip for each stop_time referenced in the gtfs stop_times.txt. Must be same length as stop_list of the itinerary_id referenced (required)

itineraries
  one folder per route_jkey
  one file per itinerary in json format
  filename: {itinerary_id}.json
  attributes:
    shape_jkey REFERENCES shapes (required)
    stop_list: list of (stop_id, stop_lat, stop_lon) in order of gtfs stop_sequence (required)
    
trips_by_route_by_hour
  one file per {service_jkey}_{route_jkey}
  filename: {service_jkey}_{route_jkey}.json
  file is a json object
  keys: hour of the day
  values: array of trip_jkeys active during that hour, for the service_jkey and route_jkey referenced in the filename
